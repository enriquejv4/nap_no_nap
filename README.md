Analysis between Napping and Non-napping Toddler's Bedtime

Our goal is to analyse data which is the result of a study that examined differences in a number of sleep variables between napping and non-napping toddlers.
Some of these sleep variables included: Bedtime (lights-off time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Onset Time (in decimalized time), 
Wake Time (sleep end time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Duration (interval between sleep onset and sleep end in minutes), 
and Total 24-Hour Sleep Duration (in minutes).

Note: [Decimalized time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time) is the representation of the time of day using units which are decimally related.

The 20 study participants were healthy, normally developing toddlers with no sleep or behavioral problems.
These children were categorized as napping or non-napping based upon parental report of childrenâ€™s habitual sleep patterns.
Researchers then verified napping status with data from actigraphy (a non-invasive method of monitoring human rest/activity cycles by wearing of a sensor on the wrist)
and sleep diaries during the 5 days before the study assessments were made.

We are specifically interested in the results for Bedtime.
